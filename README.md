### 📊 Project Title: National Enrollment & Gender Disparity Dashboard (2013–2016)

📌 [View Project Repository](https://github.com/mugdadelneama/gross-enrollment-ratio-analysis-project/tree/main)

**Tools Used: Advanced SQL, Excel, Power BI**
- Project Type: Independent Data Analysis for Policy Decision-Making
- Client Type: Internal Stakeholders (Real Dataset from Education Sector Employee)

**✅ Project Summary**
This project focused on analyzing Gross Enrollment Ratio (GER) across Indian states between 2013 and 2016. I received authentic datasets through a contact working in the education sector. My task was to transform this raw, multi-year data into actionable insights that could support educational decision-making and highlight gender and regional disparities.

This was not a training exercise — I worked on real data, solved real analytical problems, and built tools that could be used by decision-makers.


**🔵 Priority 1: Executive Dashboard**
Goal: Deliver an executive-level dashboard to help policymakers understand GER trends at a glance.

- National enrollment trends by education level (Primary to Higher Secondary)

- State-wise GER performance tracking across 4 years

- Gender-based comparison and gap detection

- Top and bottom states identified dynamically via Power BI filters

✅ Delivered: An interactive Power BI dashboard tailored for non-technical users with dynamic visuals, filters



**🟣 Priority 2: Gender Disparity Deep Dive**
- Objective: Help stakeholders identify and address gender gaps in education.

- Calculated Gender Parity Index (GPI) for every state and education level

- Flagged states with >10% gender gaps in enrollment

- Analyzed which education stages (Primary, Secondary, etc.) were most affected

- Created trend visualizations to track progress or regression over time

✅ Delivered: A comprehensive report with visuals and policy-focused recommendations for bridging gender gaps.



**🟢 Priority 3: Regional Education Assessment**

- Objective: Evaluate state performance by region and identify best practices.

- Grouped states into 5 regional zones (North, South, East, West, Northeast)

- Compared GER growth and consistency across regions

- Highlighted high-performing states with replicable strategies

- Flagged underperformers for further support and intervention

✅ Delivered: A region-based analysis highlighting strengths, weaknesses, and actionable takeaways.


**⚙️ Technical Workflow**

- Cleaned and aggregated multi-year data using advanced SQL

- Performed validation, pivoting, and exploratory work in Excel

- Developed a dynamic Power BI dashboard with drill-throughs, slicers

- Focused on storytelling with data to support real-world education policy questions
