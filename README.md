### 📊 National Enrollment & Gender Disparity Dashboard (2013–2016)  

📌 [View Project Repository](https://github.com/mugdadelneama/gross-enrollment-ratio-analysis-project)  

**Tools Used:**  
- Advanced SQL  
- Excel  
- Power BI  

**Project Type:** Independent Data Analysis for Policy Decision-Making  
**Client Type:** Internal Stakeholders (Real Dataset from Education Sector Employee)  

**✅ Project Summary**  
This project focused on analyzing Gross Enrollment Ratio (GER) across Indian states between 2013 and 2016. I received authentic datasets through a contact working in the education sector. My task was to transform this raw, multi-year data into actionable insights that could support educational decision-making and highlight gender and regional disparities.  

This was not a training exercise — I worked on **real data**, solved **real analytical problems**, and built tools that could be used by decision-makers.  

---

#### 🔵 Priority 1: Executive Dashboard  
**Goal:** Deliver an executive-level dashboard to help policymakers understand GER trends at a glance.  

- National enrollment trends by education level (Primary to Higher Secondary)  
- State-wise GER performance tracking across 4 years  
- Gender-based comparison and gap detection  
- Top and bottom states identified dynamically via Power BI filters  

**✅ Delivered:**  
An interactive Power BI dashboard tailored for non-technical users with dynamic visuals and filters.  

---

#### 🟣 Priority 2: Gender Disparity Deep Dive  
**Objective:** Help stakeholders identify and address gender gaps in education.  

- Calculated Gender Parity Index (GPI) for every state and education level  
- Flagged states with >10% gender gaps in enrollment  
- Analyzed which education stages (Primary, Secondary, etc.) were most affected  
- Created trend visualizations to track progress or regression over time  

**✅ Delivered:**  
A comprehensive report with visuals and policy-focused recommendations for bridging gender gaps.  

---

#### 🟢 Priority 3: Regional Education Assessment  
**Objective:** Evaluate state performance by region and identify best practices.  

- Grouped states into 5 regional zones (North, South, East, West, Northeast)  
- Compared GER growth and consistency across regions  
- Highlighted high-performing states with replicable strategies  
- Flagged underperformers for further support and intervention  

**✅ Delivered:**  
A region-based analysis highlighting strengths, weaknesses, and actionable takeaways.
